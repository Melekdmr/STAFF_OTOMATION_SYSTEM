The STAFF OTOMATION SYSTEM project is a desktop application developed using C# and SQL Server. This system performs basic operations such as saving, deleting, updating, and clearing employee information in the database. Additionally, a DataGridView control is used to display personnel data in tabular format. Users can statistically analyze and visualize the added employee data graphically. With the graphing and statistical extraction feature, the system provides quick analyses of personnel numbers and other data. The application offers efficient and easy usage with its user-friendly interface. To run the project, it is necessary to create the required tables in SQL Server and configure the connection settings.
